## Source

Our teacher brought in some fresh flowers for us to paint today. I
picked some sort of purple thing to try:

## Sketch and start

I sketched a few blossoms, not trying for much detail, and started
painting in the heads. I wanted to keep the white band around each
petal, and made sure not to fill them all the way out.

For the petals, I used a mixture of permanent alizerin crimson and
cobalt blue to get the purple. I wanted it a bit more red than it came
out, but this is still nice.

Initially I tried to use a wet in wet, putting a bead of water in each
petal and then dropping in colour at the base of the petal. This
didn't work as I'd hoped, so I used a #4 round and painted carefully
in each one.

I then painted the negative background in a pretty bright aureolin
(cobalt yellow) to bring out the edges.

## Finishing up the purple flowers

I went through and finished the purple flowers, filling in the inside
of each with a mixture of sap green and aureolin, with dots of sap
green.

The leaves were sap green and some cobalt blue. I scratched the veins
of the leaves in while still wet. The stems are sap green on one side
and aureolin on the other, blending together.

Outside, I washed some of the purple-violet on the left, and some quin
burnt orange on the left.

### Partial flowers, near complete

## A couple of roses

In class, our teacher told us a "cheat" on how to paint roses quickly,
as a set of inverting triangles around each other.

This is one following that technique:

This one I did by hand, fast and loose, without a subject:

## Final, everything

As this was an exercise, I did everything on one sheet on the block:
